# SUDOKU-GAME for kids
### * Sudoku-game  built using C *
The rules of Sudoku are very simple.
Sudoku contains 4 rows and 4 columns, so 16 cells in total.

The goal of the game is to fill these boxes with numbers ranging from 1 to 4 or one of the four figures (rectangle, square, circle, or triangle) 
while always ensuring that the same number or figure only appears once per column, once per row, and once per square of nine cells.

At the start of the game, one or more numbers or figures are already placed and you still have to find the others.
 Indeed, a correctly constituted initial Sudoku grid can only lead to one and only one solution. Finding the missing figures or 
 figures is all a matter of logic and observation.
In addition to that each player will have a score that will allow him to compete with other players in terms of score and level.
